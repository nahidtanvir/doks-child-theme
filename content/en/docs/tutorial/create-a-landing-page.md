## Overview

Landing page is typically the page from where one starts browsing a website. It contains all the key
information, marketing promotions and email. The most common goal of the page is lead generation.

## Page Structure

Each page has the following common components.
* Top Menu
* Main Menu
* Sidebar
* Footer Menu

A page can have its own components mentioned above or inherit them from the site. To keep it simple lets create
each of the components and add them to the entire site. After that we will create the main contents of the page.
