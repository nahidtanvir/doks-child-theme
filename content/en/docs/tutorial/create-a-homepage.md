## Overview

Landing page is typically the page from where one starts browsing a website. It contains all the key
information, marketing promotions and email. The most common goal of the page is lead generation.

## Add Menus with Initial Data

Each page has the following common menu components.
* Top Menu
* Main Menu
* Footer Menu

A page can have its own menus or inherit them from the site. To keep it simple lets create
each of these menus for the entire site using some initial values. We will finalize them later.

### Top Menu


### Main Menu


### Footer Menu


## Add Content

Let us follow a prebuilt design to add content to the page. Here is the sample we are going to follow to create the page.
However we are going to create only a few of the components to keep it short.
